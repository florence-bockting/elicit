should I simulate the full data set in the generative model and then select the relevant observations in the target computation step?
Disadvantage: Makes model slower
Advantage: When I have follow-up computations such as R2 this is not very reasonable on a reduced data set of, say, 6 obs.

I don't apply an exp/softmax transformation on the scale parameters.
I rather apply abs() on the scale-results -> I saw difficulties in learning when using this additional transformation.
